A suggested cause for the error will be given as long as the card number entered begins with a 3, 4, 5 or 6. The module also has added its own configuration variables for checking the the length of the name on the card and the card number just in case they get removed from the osCommerce install since osCommerce no longer includes a credit card payment module like this one. The module configuration variable keys have been updated to reflect the actual name of the module.<br />
<br />
The credit card box module has been updated to enable caching of the box information and thereby reduce database access if caching is enabled in admin - configuration - cache. <br />
<br />
Instructions have been added for an agree to terms of sale box on the checkout confirmation page.<br />
<br />
Three defunct card types have been removed from the instructions SQL and their images deleted from the contribution. Updated images are provided for Visa, MasterCard and JCB. The card pattern definitions have also been updated with current information.<br />
<br />
The entire contribution is enclosed. New installs should use the latest version of this contribution to be sure everything works correctly.<br />
<br />
If you have an older version of this module and wish to upgrade you should proceed as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Go into admin - modules -payment and REMOVE the credit card module. The configuration key names have been changed in this version so you need to get rid of the old ones by removing the older module before replacing it with this one.<br />
<br />
2) Replace the following changed PHP files:<br />
catalog/includes/modules/payment/credit_card.php<br />
catalog/includes/languages/english/modules/payment/credit_card.php<br />
catalog/includes/modules/boxes/bm_credit_cards.php<br />
catalog/admin/credit_cards.php<br />
<br />
3) Install instructions 22 and 24 have been updated with the new module configuration key names. Find where you have the original MODULE_PAYMENT_CC_ names in these two files and change them to the new MODULE_PAYMENT_CREDIT_CARD_ names as noted in these two instructions.<br />
<br />
4) If you want to add the agree to terms feature then follow install instructions 25 and onward which are new to this version of the contribution.<br />
<br />
5) Go to admin - modules - payment and reinstall the credit card module.<br />
<br />
6) The card patterns for Discover, Diners Club, JCB and Maestro have been updated. If your store accepts any of these cards you should go to admin -configuration - credit cards and edit these cards. Replace the existing patterns with the updated ones from this version of the install instructions. You can also delete the Laser, Switch and Solo cards originally included with this contribution as these cards are all now defunct.";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Sun, 26 Apr 2015 01:32:33 +0200";}i:2;a:4:{s:5:"title";s:26:"CardConnect Payment Module";s:4:"link";s:38:"http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/9200";s:11:"description";s:63:"- Updated to support eWallet functions for returning customers.";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 20:30:37 +0200";}i:3;a:4:{s:5:"title";s:26:"Category Description v1.00";s:4:"link";s:38:"http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/2343";s:11:"description";s:79:"Changed index.php so that this now works with boot strap version of osCommerce.";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Sun, 19 Apr 2015 20:10:17 +0200";}i:4;a:4:{s:5:"title";s:45:"Multiple Sales Per Product for osCommerce 2.3";s:4:"link";s:38:"http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/8593";s:11:"description";s:1505:"Recently we discovered that the multi-nested select queries that I used when I created this contribution were causing some really bad slow downs on our web site. Our site has over 14,000 products (over 11,000 active) and between this and other contributions some search queries were slogging through millions of rows! With this revision the number of rows examined drops to match the total number of products. This contribution now uses a couple of user defined MySQL functions to quickly load the proper sale price and expiration date in those queries (primarily index.php and advanced search) where the sale price needs to be loaded with the query and not at a later time as is done on the product information page.<br />
<br />
For those who have already installed this contribution it is highly recommended that you update to this version so you can avoid the slowdowns that we experienced. No changes have been made to the included PHP files. To update you only need to make the changes as noted below. The following instruction changes have been made:<br />
<br />
The product index created by osCommerce is dropped in favor of a new special sort index that can also be used like the product index.<br />
<br />
Instruction 0 is added and required for all other changed instructions. Make sure you apply that change first.<br />
<br />
The following instructions have changed: 13a, 14, 15 (all parts), 16b and 18.<br />
<br />
The complete contribution is attached with the new install instructions.";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Sun, 19 Apr 2015 00:05:50 +0200";}}s:11:"items_count";i:5;}
