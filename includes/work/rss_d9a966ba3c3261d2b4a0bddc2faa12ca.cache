<br />
Unlike Monthly Sales &amp; Tax Report which calculate sales out of every product in table orders_products this Add-On will query the database and calculate sales based on each orders_total class which greatly increases query time. Example: with a database of 30 000 example orders, this Add-On will finish in just 1.5 seconds.<br />

This Add-On uses jQuery DataTables to create the Table.<br />
