Our site has over 14,000 products (over 11,000 active) and between this and other contributions some search queries were slogging through millions of rows! With this revision the number of rows examined drops to match the total number of products. This contribution now uses a couple of user defined MySQL functions to quickly load the proper sale price and expiration date in those queries (primarily index.php and advanced search) where the sale price needs to be loaded with the query and not at a later time as is done on the product information page.<br />
<br />
For those who have already installed this contribution it is highly recommended that you update to this version so you can avoid the slowdowns that we experienced. No changes have been made to the included PHP files. To update you only need to make the changes as noted below. The following instruction changes have been made:<br />
<br />
The product index created by osCommerce is dropped in favor of a new special sort index that can also be used like the product index.<br />
<br />
Instruction 0 is added and required for all other changed instructions. Make sure you apply that change first.<br />
<br />
The following instructions have changed: 13a, 14, 15 (all parts), 16b and 18.<br />
<br />
The complete contribution is attached with the new install instructions.";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Sun, 19 Apr 2015 00:05:50 +0200";}i:1;a:4:{s:5:"title";s:8:"Wishlist";s:4:"link";s:38:"http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/8665";s:11:"description";s:608:"ONLY FOR BOOTSTRAP VERSION!<br />
